# Assigments

## LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and 
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console


## LECTURE: Data Types
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your 
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the consol

## LECTURE: let, const and var (Declaring variables)
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some 
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never 
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happen
