# Assigments

## LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and 
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console


## LECTURE: Data Types
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your 
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the consol

## LECTURE: let, const and var (Declaring variables)
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some 
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never 
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happen

## LECTURE: Basic Operators
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, 
then how many people would live in each half?
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country 
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million 
people speak portuguese


## LECTURE: Strings and Template Literals
1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time 
using the template literal syntax
LECTURE: Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the 
console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like 
'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33 
minus the country's population)
2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 
130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
LECTURE: Type Conversion and Coercion
1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
'9' - '5';
'19' - '13' + '17';
'19' - '13' + 17;
'123' < 57;
5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2;
2. Execute the operations to check if you were right
The Complete JavaScript Course 7
LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this: 
prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country 
have?');
2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality 
== for now)
3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
is greater than 1
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when 
'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of 
'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why 
is this happening?
7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now 
when you input 1
8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this 
situation

## LECTURE: Logical Operators
1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a 
country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an 
island.
3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. 
You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take 
your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If 
not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily 
change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in 
Canada :D

## LECTURE: The switch Statement
1. Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given 'language':
chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!'
spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers'
english: '3rd place'
hindi: 'Number 4'
arabic: '5th most spoken language'
for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'

## LECTURE: The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator 
to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. 
Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
one word changes between these two sentences!
2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 
130. See the different results, and set the population back to original

## LECTURE: Functions
1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters: 
'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the 
function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its 
capital city is Helsinki'
2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the 
returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console

## LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions
1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
returns the percentage of the world population that the given population 
represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of 
the world population
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900 
and then multiply by 100
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice, 
store the results into variables, and log them to the console
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called 
'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be 
the same populations)

## LECTURE: Arrow Functions
1. Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function called 
'percentageOfWorld3'

## LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions
1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you 
like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and 
'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people, 
which is about 18.2% of the world.'
2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the 
'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice

## LECTURE: Introduction to Arrays
1. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice. 
You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a 
variable called 'populations'
2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)
3. Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the 
world population for these 4 population values. Use the function 
'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4 
percentage values

# Codding Challenges

## Fundamentals Part 1

### Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:

- Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
- Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.

### Coding Challenge #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement 

### Coding Challenge #3

There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that 
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a 
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a 
score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum 
score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ;)
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when 
both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 
points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
ยง Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

### Coding Challenge #4
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ๐ (If it's easier for you, you can 
start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
(bill + tip). Example: โThe bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
316.25โ

Test data:
- Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

Hints:
- To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
- Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ๐

## Fundamentals Part #2

### Coding Challenge #1
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new 
gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so 
one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. 
Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:
1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team 
as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner 
to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. 
Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and 
Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time
 
Test data:

- Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
- Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

### Coding Challenge #2
Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of 
the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 
20%.
Your tasks:
1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns 
the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out 
the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function 
type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data 
below
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from 
the function you created before
4. Bonus: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip
Test data: 125, 555 and 44
Hint: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can 
actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array 
values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new 
array)


### Coding Challenge #3
Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to 
implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass 
/ (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
Your tasks:
1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and 
height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same 
method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it 
from the method
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the 
respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"
Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m 
tall.
