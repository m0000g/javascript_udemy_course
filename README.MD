# Assigments

## LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and 
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console


## LECTURE: Data Types
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your 
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the consol

## LECTURE: let, const and var (Declaring variables)
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some 
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never 
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happen

## LECTURE: Basic Operators
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, 
then how many people would live in each half?
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country 
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million 
people speak portuguese

# Codding Challenges

## Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.
GOOD LUCK
